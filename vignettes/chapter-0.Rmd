# Datasets

The datasets were already processed and tidied following the steps in the
original code by Professor Hansen. The goal is to go directly to writing
functions in C++.

# Notation

In the textbook, the notation is of the form:

$$
Y_i = \beta_1 X_{i1} + \beta_2 X_{i2} + \ldots + \beta_k X_{ik} + \beta_0 + e_i,
$$

where $Y_i$ is the dependent variable, $X_{ij}$ are the independent variables,
$\beta_j$ are the coefficients, and $e_i$ is the error term.

In these notes I use the following notation:

$$
Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{i1} + \beta_2 X_{i2} + \ldots + \beta_k X_{ik} + e_i.
$$
